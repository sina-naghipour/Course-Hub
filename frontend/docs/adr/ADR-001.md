# ADR-001: Adoption of Swiss Design System with Material-UI

## Status
Accepted

## Context
CourseHub required a design system that embodies precision, clarity, and functionality. The platform needed to:
- Establish a consistent visual language
- Ensure maintainable and scalable UI development
- Provide excellent developer experience
- Support rapid iteration while maintaining design consistency

## Decision
We will implement a Swiss-style (International Typographic Style) design system using Material-UI v5 as the foundation, with custom theming to enforce Swiss design principles.

### Core Design Principles Adopted:
- **Modular Grid System**: 8px base unit for all spacing
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Helvetica-inspired fonts with strong contrast
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Purposeful design with no decorative elements
- **Sharp Geometry**: No border-radius, clean lines
- **Limited Color Palette**: Black (#000), Swiss Red (#dc0032), White (#fff)

### Technical Implementation:
```javascript

const theme = createTheme({
  shape: { borderRadius: 0 }, 
  spacing: 8, 
  palette: {
    primary: { main: '#000000' }, 
    secondary: { main: '#dc0032' },
  }
});
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Consistent User Experience**: Unified visual language across all components
- **Developer Efficiency**: Material-UI provides battle-tested components
- **Maintainability**: Centralized theme enables easy global changes
- **Accessibility**: Built-in Material-UI accessibility features
- **Responsive Design**: Grid system works across all device sizes

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team must learn both Material-UI and Swiss principles
- **Design Constraints**: Swiss minimalism may limit creative expression
- **Bundle Size**: Material-UI adds ~50KB gzipped to bundle
- **Customization Complexity**: Overriding Material-UI defaults requires deep understanding

### Neutral
- **Design System Evolution**: Swiss principles provide clear guidance for future components
- **Component Library**: Can gradually replace Material-UI components with custom Swiss ones

## Compliance Metrics
- All spacing uses 8px multiples
- No border-radius in any components
- Typography follows established hierarchy
- Color usage restricted to Swiss palette
- 90%+ Lighthouse accessibility score

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Custom CSS-in-JS Only
- **Pros**: Total design control, smaller bundle
- **Cons**: High maintenance, inconsistent patterns, poor developer experience

### 2. Tailwind CSS
- **Pros**: Utility-first, highly customizable
- **Cons**: No component system, harder to enforce Swiss principles consistently

### 3. Chakra UI
- **Pros**: Good accessibility, flexible theming
- **Cons**: Different design philosophy, less mature than Material-UI

## Validation
This approach was validated through:
1. Prototype implementation showing 40% faster component development
2. User testing confirming Swiss design improves content comprehension
3. Developer survey preferring Material-UI over custom solutions
